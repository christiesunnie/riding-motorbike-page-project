# Riding motorbike in Ontario

This page is made as I wanted to share some info about riding motorcycle in Ontario, Canada. There are 4 main sections:

1. About me
2. Things must know

- If you want to ride in Ontario, you need to know the rules
- I have recommendations for Helmet choices

3. Fun facts about bikes
4. My personal tips

Riding is my favorite hobby which I will do when I dont code. I hope the page will give you some useful info.
